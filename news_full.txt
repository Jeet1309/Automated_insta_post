US stocks were mixed on Tuesday as President Trump's massive budget bill passed in the Senate and Wall Street watched for progress on trade talks.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed down 0.1%, pulling back from a record close after finishing above 6,200 for the first time on Monday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell around 0.7%, with Tesla (TSLA) stock sliding 5% as CEO Elon Musk's feud with Trump flared up again.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 1%, largely led by a pop in healthcare stocks including United Healthcare (UNH), which rose 4.5%.

Senate lawmakers voted 50-50, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie, to pass Trump's signature tax and spending bill, racing to meet the president's desired July 4 deadline. The bill now goes back to the House, which will vote on the Senate's changes.

Republicans wrangled over the bill's measures overnight, including one amendment that passed with strong bipartisan support: A strike-down of the ban on state-level AI regulation. They also ended up slightly softening a phase out of clean-energy tax credits.

Another looming deadline has prompted the US to scale back Trump's push for full-blown "reciprocal" deals with trading partners, the Financial Times reported. Instead, officials are racing to find narrower agreements before July 9, when the president's sweeping "reciprocal" tariffs are set to resume.

Meanwhile, investors closely watched commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and labor market data as debate intensifies over when the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates.

Jerome Powell spoke about the Fed's policy stance at an ECB forum in Portgual on Tuesday, fresh from another Trump attack pushing the Federal Reserve chair to slash interest rates to 1% â€” a huge 250-point reduction. Powell remarked that tariffs are causing the central bank to take its time before cutting interest rates, but he said the US economy remains healthy overall.

Fresh data Tuesday showed job openings rose more than expected in May. The hiring and quits rates remain near decade lows, reflecting what economists have described as a labor market in "stasis."
